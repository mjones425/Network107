            <h2>Welcome to the NFL HBCU Resources Page!</h2>
            <h3>NFL + HBCUs</h3>
            <p class="paragraph">
                The NFL is proud of the legacy of Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) on professional football.
                Throughout the league's history, athletes from HBCUs have exemplified a standard of excellence on and off the field. The NFL's partnership
                with HBCUs works to celebrate history, increase oppurtunites, and provide access to career oppurtunities.
            </p>
            <h3>Honoring HBCU History</h3>
            <p class="paragraph">
                The elite brotherhood of HBCU players has had a tremendous impact on football and in the communities in which they 
                have played, exemplifying excellence on and off the field.HBCU players represent only a small portion of the total 
                football population, yet nearly 10% of all players in the Pro Football Hall of Fame attended HBCUs (34 out of 354 members).
            </p>
            <h3>Strengthening HBCUs</h3>
            <p class="paragraph">
                Since the NFL began its partnership with HBCUs in 2016 with the Strength of HBCUs initiative, more than 3,000 HBCU students 
                have participated in Football Operations’ various HBCU programming focused on student and administrator development, career exposure, and networking.<br><br>
                <b>The HBCU Careers in Football Forum</b> was designed to inspire, develop and connect undergraduate and graduate students with industry professionals and league partners.<br><br>
                <b> Campus Connection</b> was launched by the NFL and Howard University in 2018 to introduce and prepare students for potential careers in professional football administration.<br><br>
                <b>NFL + HBCU Open House</b> is an annual event hosted by the NFL Football Operations department, brings together stakeholders across HBCUs and football to discuss NFL initiatives, 
                areas of opportunities and further strengthen relationships.<br><br>
                <b>HBCU Battle of the Brains</b> is a competition that brings top students and industry leaders together to showcase students’ skills through skills challenges, mentoring and
                 professional development.<br><br>
            </p>
            <h3>Coaching & Playing Oppurtunities</h3>
            <p class="paragraph">
                Career forums, workshops, internships and other opportunities equip HBCU students, players and coaches with access to programs to develop the skills needed to work or play in professional football.
                Examples of these oppurtunites include the HBCU Combine, HBCU Legacy Bowl, and the Quarterback Coaching Summit.
